# Databricks Certified Data Engineer Associate: Study Resources & Code Examples

This repository serves as a collection of study materials, notes, and code examples aimed at helping individuals prepare for the **Databricks Certified Data Engineer Associate** exam.

The Databricks Lakehouse Platform and its underlying technologies like Apache Spark, Delta Lake, and Unity Catalog are key components of modern data engineering workflows. This repository is intended to provide a structured approach to learning and practicing the concepts covered in the certification exam.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to consolidate resources and provide practical examples for the following:

*   Understanding core data engineering concepts on the Databricks platform.
*   Deepening knowledge of Apache Spark for data processing.
*   Learning about Delta Lake features for building reliable data lakes.
*   Exploring the Lakehouse architecture and patterns like the Medallion architecture.
*   Becoming familiar with Databricks platform components and their usage.
*   Practicing common data ingestion, transformation, and management tasks using code.

## Repository Structure

The repository is likely organized into directories covering specific topics relevant to the Databricks Certified Data Engineer Associate exam. You can navigate through the folders to find detailed notes and corresponding code examples.

Possible directory structure might include topics such as:

*   `01-Spark-Fundamentals`
*   `02-Delta-Lake`
*   `03-Lakehouse-Architecture`
*   `04-Medallion-Architecture`
*   `05-Databricks-Platform`
*   `06-Data-Ingestion`
*   `07-Data-Transformation`
*   `08-Data-Governance`
*   `09-Workloads`
*   `10-Cloud-Integration`
*   ... and other relevant topics.

Each folder should contain relevant documentation (e.g., Markdown files, PDFs) and code examples (e.g., Databricks Notebooks in `.ipynb`, `.html`, or `.dbc` format).

## Key Topics Covered (Relevant to Certification)

The materials in this repository are expected to cover key areas tested in the Databricks Certified Data Engineer Associate exam, including but not limited to:

*   **Apache Spark:** Core concepts (RDDs, DataFrames, Spark SQL), transformations and actions, lazy evaluation, Spark architecture, handling skewed data, monitoring.
*   **Delta Lake:** Introduction to Delta Lake, ACID transactions, Schema Enforcement and Evolution, Time Travel, `MERGE`, `COPY INTO`, performance optimization (Z-Ordering, compaction).
*   **Lakehouse Architecture:** Understanding the unification of data lakes and warehouses, the Lakehouse benefits.
*   **Medallion Architecture:** Implementing Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers for data quality and structure.
*   **Databricks Platform:** Workspace components (Notebooks, Clusters, Jobs, Repos), Control Plane vs. Compute Plane, Classic vs. Serverless compute, Workspace File System (DBFS), Workspace configuration.
*   **Data Ingestion & Transformation:** Batch and Structured Streaming, Auto Loader, ETL/ELT patterns.
*   **Data Governance:** Unity Catalog concepts (Metastore, Catalog, Schema, Table, Volume), access control (Grants), Data Lineage.
*   **Databricks SQL:** Using SQL endpoints for BI and analytics.
*   **MLflow:** Basic understanding of MLflow for experiment tracking and model management (as relevant to data engineers).
*   **Cloud Integration:** Understanding how Databricks interacts with cloud storage (S3, ADLS Gen2, GCS) and identity services (IAM, AAD).

## Prerequisites

To make the most of the resources in this repository, it is recommended that you have:

*   A basic understanding of data engineering concepts.
*   Familiarity with SQL.
*   Experience with at least one programming language commonly used in data engineering (Python is most common for Spark/Databricks).
*   Access to a Databricks workspace (Databricks Community Edition is often sufficient for basic Spark and Delta Lake concepts, but some features like Unity Catalog or Serverless SQL Endpoints may require a paid tier).
*   Basic knowledge of using Git and GitHub (cloning repositories).

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/karthick180887/Databricks-Certified-Data-Engineer-Associate.git
    cd Databricks-Certified-Data-Engineer-Associate
    ```
2.  **Explore Content:** Navigate through the topic folders (e.g., `01-Spark-Fundamentals`, `04-Medallion-Architecture`) to find notes and code.
3.  **Import Notebooks:** If you find Databricks notebook files (like `.ipynb` or exported `.html`/`.dbc`), import them into your Databricks workspace to run the code interactively. In your Databricks workspace, you can typically go to `Workspace` -> `Import` and upload the file.
4.  **Read Documentation:** Review the notes and explanations provided alongside the code examples.
